# Lessons BG
*LessonsBG is an application that I built for the ASP.NET Core course at SoftUni. 
The main idea of LessonsBG is to be a website that lets you easily find teachers, trainers and academies in Bulgaria, so that you can learn something new or get help with something that you are learning already. There is also a blog and news areas where you can read some interesting news or blog posts. *

### *Note:*
*Please note that in the images of the project that you are going to see, all testiomonials, people names, phone numbers and images are mocks.*


###*Here are some screenshots of the main parts of the website :*
